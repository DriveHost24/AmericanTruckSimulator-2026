## 🌾 Heavy Farm Equipment Transport

Beet harvesters are large agricultural machines used in farming operations. Transporting this type of oversized and heavy equipment in ATS adds a serious realism factor to the gameplay.

At 65,000 pounds, this load demands:

✔ Smooth acceleration
✔ Wide turning angles
✔ Controlled downhill braking
✔ Proper gear management
✔ Maintaining highway stability

The International LoneStar’s 605HP engine provides strong torque delivery, making hill climbs easier even with a heavy load. The 18-speed transmission allows fine control over RPM and speed, especially when merging into traffic or navigating elevation changes.

## 🛣️ California Highway & Desert Driving

Starting in Oxnard near the California coast, we transition from urban highways into more open stretches of road. As we head toward Indio, the environment changes into desert terrain with long straight highways and potential crosswinds.

This route includes:

* Highway merging traffic
* Elevation changes
* Long desert stretches
* Careful braking on declines
* Heavy cargo stability management

Driving heavy equipment across desert roads adds immersion and realism to the ATS experience. Maintaining safe speed and avoiding sharp steering inputs is key when hauling agricultural machinery.

## 🎮 What You’ll Experience in This Gameplay:

* Realistic ATS heavy cargo physics
* International LoneStar engine sound
* Interior cockpit driving view
* Smooth long-distance highway cruising
* California desert scenery
* Professional heavy load driving techniques

Heavy cargo deliveries in ATS always bring a different level of challenge compared to standard freight. The added weight affects acceleration, braking distance, and cornering stability—making every mile more engaging.
