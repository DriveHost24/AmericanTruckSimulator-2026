This Quick Job features a **60,000 lb Tamping Machine**, transported from **San Diego, California to Bakersfield, California**, covering a total distance of **273 miles**.

This job may not look oversized at first glance, but hauling 60,000 pounds across California highways demands smooth throttle control, proper gear management, and smart braking—especially with elevation changes and traffic conditions along the route.

Driving the Kenworth W900 is always a pleasure. Its long nose design, classic American styling, and powerful engine make it perfect for heavy cargo runs like this. The torque delivery helps maintain speed on inclines, while the 18-speed gearbox provides full control when climbing or descending hills.

During this journey, we experience:
✔ Realistic California highways
✔ Smooth long-distance cruising
✔ Engine sound immersion
✔ Heavy cargo handling
✔ Realistic traffic conditions
✔ Careful braking & downhill control

The route from San Diego to Bakersfield offers a mix of urban traffic, open highways, and gradual elevation changes. Maintaining stability with a 60,000 lb load requires careful acceleration and proper use of engine braking.
