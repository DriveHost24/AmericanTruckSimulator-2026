## 🌉 Driving Through Northern California

Starting in San Francisco means navigating tight urban roads, highway merges, and realistic California traffic. Exiting the Bay Area requires patience and precision, especially when hauling chemical cargo.

As we head toward Stockton, the route opens up into smoother highways and valley roads. Even though the weight isn’t extremely heavy, hazardous cargo changes the entire driving approach:

✔ Smooth acceleration
✔ Early braking
✔ Controlled cornering
✔ Safe lane discipline
✔ Defensive driving in traffic

The **Peterbilt 389** delivers a classic American trucking experience. With its long nose design and powerful engine, it provides stable performance and strong torque output. The 18-speed gearbox allows precise control, especially when managing speed in traffic or descending highway slopes.

## ⚠ Why Hazardous Cargo Is Different

Transporting chlorine isn’t just about reaching the destination. It’s about:

* Avoiding sudden braking
* Maintaining safe speed limits
* Preventing rollovers
* Keeping distance from other vehicles
* Avoiding collisions at all costs

In ATS, hazardous deliveries increase immersion and realism. The pressure of delivering safely adds an extra challenge compared to standard cargo runs.
